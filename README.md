# Portfolio Website

This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio website, featuring a home page and a contact page.

## Overview
This portfolio website, built using HTML and basic CSS, is a simple yet effective showcase of my professional information. It consists of two main pages: a home page that provides an introduction to my work, and a contact page allowing visitors to reach out to me easily.

## Pages
- **Home Page**: Contains information about my professional background, skills, and featured projects.
- **Contact Page**: Provides various ways to get in touch with me, such as through a contact form, email, or social media links.

## Features
- **HTML Structure**: Both pages are primarily built using HTML to structure the content.
- **Basic CSS Styling**: Basic CSS is used to style the elements, ensuring a clean and presentable layout on both pages.

## Usage
Explore the code to understand the structure of the website. The `index.html` file represents the home page, while `contact.html` contains the contact information.
